# UserVoiceShow
## ⚠️ Attention the plugin does not show where you are sitting, I found it pointless

&ensp;

## ❓ DM the author or create an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/eternal-hatred/BetterDiscordStuff/issues) for support.

&ensp;

## The plugin shows where the user is if you hover over button with channel name you can get into the voice if you have access.
